""" The Instance model is the container for a full Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) input.
It holds:

Depot(s): either a single depot or multiple depots.
Vehicles: list of all vehicles in the fleet.
Customers: list of customer nodes with demand and constraints.

In short: Instance is the root data structure that defines the optimization problem input â€” the combination of depots, vehicles, 
and customers that the algorithms will solve. """
