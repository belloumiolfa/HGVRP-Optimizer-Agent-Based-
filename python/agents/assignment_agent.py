""" AssignmentAgent takes a problem Instance and turns it into an evaluatable routing context: it wraps depots/customers into agents, 
builds a customer distance matrix, converts external route IDs into internal indices, and provides utilities to compute leg/route 
distances and a nearest-customer heuristic. Its core method evaluate(...) simulates and scores a set of routes (one per vehicle) by 
delegating per-route evaluation to VehicleAgent, then aggregates objectives (distance, waiting, vehicles used, fuel, emissions, cost) 
and penalties (capacity, duration, time windows, driver availability, battery, coverage, and depot supply). """
